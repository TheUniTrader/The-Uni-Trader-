### Notes : Like my trading I don’t really know where to start with this. I have finally found a good reliable sim platform ( IG trading ) to practise from. Whether I use this further down the line  IF I ever move to a live account I really don’t know. Why am I doing this is another question that I don’t know the answer to. After Watching ImanTrading for some time now, he seems to be a reliable source. Honest with free resources and he took a long journey with lots of hard work to become profitable with one of his big points being about journaling hence why I feel like I should give it a go. 
Today I just messed around on the sim putting a few trades on here and there testing various stop losses and random entries with a clear point that I’m a beginner. I feel like I can make progress but I need to stay consistent and just be willing to learn. I’m going to ( reluctantly )  reset the sim back to the original balance and then start recording my trades and observations so I get a better indicator of what’s happening. I feel like I should try and understand how to utilise ATR more and try and start to find some sort of strategy that works for me or at least trial various different ones. 
Currently, my biggest fear is that I will keep putting up trades but when analysing, I just wont understand why my trades aren’t working and what to do next but maybe I should give it time and I will start recognising my mistakes. The key takeaway is to just give this some time, there’s lots to learn.
